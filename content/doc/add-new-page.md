To create a new article, access the `pages` folder, and create a new markdown file, for example `mypage.md`, then add the following frontmatter format.

```
---
title: Page Title
description: This is a description of your static page.
---
Then fill in the article content here
```

You can also copy and paste from one of the articles, then change the name of the markdown file, and update the article content.
