If you need to update navbar menu and url, you can simply change in to `config,yml` file, and update this area.

```
navbar:
 - nav: "Home"
   url: "/"
 - nav: "About"
   url: "/page/about"
 - nav: "Tags"
   url: "/tags"
 - nav: "Contact"
   url: "/page/contact-us"
```

Name is for your navbar menu name, and url is for link url for your navbar menu.
